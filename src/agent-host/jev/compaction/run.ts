 * (result staleness) whose confident answer can rescue a borderline result.
 * Batches run concurrently; the same fitted state is sent with each.
 *
 * Recency is pi's job: pi has already kept the newest
 * `compaction.keepRecentTokens` tokens out of the span, so nothing here is
 * pinned or excluded for being recent. The one exception is the call at the
 * cut boundary (`boundaryCallId`): it is scored like the rest, but a Jev
 * `drop_call` is softened to keeping the call and a bounded result head.
